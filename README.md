The scripts are designed to control swipes through your pc's webcam.

P.S. At the moment the implementation works as follows - place 2 fingers horizontally on the webcam, with your palm facing the webcam, and when you increase the range by 20 degrees, you get a swipe

P.S.S. Now there is a bug that scrolling only works up
